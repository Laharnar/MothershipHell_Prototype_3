# MothershipHell_Prototype_3
Game where you control a mothership in space, to fight a huge amount of enemies.

This is 3rd project of this type so far, bullet hell with player controlling the mothership.
Focus of this project will be to recreate the old space ship systems for AI, but with new knowledge aquired from my current job and team projects like game jams and family projects.

Final result should be at least 10 minutes of playable prototype with spaceships using AI, turrets, building and missions.
